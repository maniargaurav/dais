\tTask: db:schema

\tIt can be beneficial to get a dump of the DB in raw SQL format which represents
\tthe current version.

\tNote: This dump only contains the actual schema (e.g. the DML needed to
\treconstruct the DB), but not any actual data.

\tIn MySQL terms, this task would not be the same as running the mysqldump command
\t(which by defaults does include any data in the tables).
